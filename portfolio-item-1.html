        <div class="portfolio-item-individual">
            <p>  I created a Tableau dashboard to analyze a 9-month social media campaign, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and distributing visualizations across multiple dashboards for detailed analysis.
                
            </p>
           
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-item-individual">
            <p>  Monthly Overview Dashboard:
                The dashboard features sparklines and Month-over-Month (MoM) comparisons for KPIs, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. Below the MoM charts, I added two additional bar charts:
                The Conversion and Click-Through Rate by Months chart reveals user engagement trends and conversion patterns over time.
                The Total Spend and Total Revenue chart juxtaposes ad spend and revenue trends, offering insights into financial performance and campaign efficiency.

        <div class="portfolio-item-individual">
            <p>  Channel Analysis Dashboard:
                I further analyzed the campaign by designing three dashboards focused on channel performance, ad types, and campaign types, which provided a deeper understanding of performance trends and recurring patterns across metrics.
                Channel Dashboard: While Facebook had the highest impressions and expenditure, Instagram proved to be the most lucrative channel, with higher revenue, conversion rates, and clicks compared to Facebook and Pinterest.

        <div class="portfolio-item-individual">
            <p>  Ad Type Dashboard:
                Discount Ads generated 62.02% of the total revenue, with a higher ROAS (£11.79 vs. £9.11) compared to Collection Ads.
                Collection Ads received more impressions but had a lower click-through rate (CTR) and fewer conversions than Discount Ads.
                A scatterplot of clicks and conversions revealed that Collection Ads, despite receiving more clicks, were less effective at driving conversions. These insights suggest prioritizing Discount Ads for future campaigns while refining Collection Ads for better engagement.

        <div class="portfolio-item-individual">
            <p>  Campaign Dashboard:
                This dashboard compared the Spring, Summer, and Fall campaigns across financial and engagement metrics:
                The Fall campaign performed the best in terms of impressions (£6M) and revenue (£749,006, 43% of total revenue). It also had the highest number of clicks (46.87%) and conversions (36.98%).
                However, it was the most expensive campaign, with a lower ROAS (£9.44) compared to Spring and Summer. The visuals highlighted a low conversion rate despite high engagement (85k clicks). Future strategies should focus on reducing costs and improving conversion rates for the Fall campaign.
                The Summer campaign had the highest conversion rate (32.9%), the lowest cost-per-acquisition (CPA), and the highest ROAS (£14) despite having the fewest clicks (38k). This suggests the Summer campaign has strong potential for further refinement and optimization.
